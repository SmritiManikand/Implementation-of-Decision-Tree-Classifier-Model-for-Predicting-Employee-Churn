# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## Aim:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the required packages.
2. Read the data set.
3. Apply label encoder to the non-numerical column inoreder to convert into numerical values.
4. Determine training and test data set.
5. Apply decision tree Classifier and get the values of accuracy and data prediction.

## Program:
